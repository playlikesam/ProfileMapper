# React + TypeScript + Vite
To implement the Profile Mapper application, we created reusable components like ProfileCard, ProfileList, and ProfileMap, and set up routing for pages such as Home, Admin, and ProfileDetails. We defined the Profile type to structure the profile data, which includes name, photo, description, and geographical location. The Home page displays a list of profiles, and users can click the "Summary" button to navigate to the ProfileDetails page, where the profile's location is displayed interactively on a Google Map. We integrated React Router for navigation and used Material UI for UI components.

## What's left:
we need to integrate Mapbox or Google Maps for the map functionality (API key configuration).

Implement admin functionality for adding, editing, and deleting profiles in the Admin page.

Add Search and Filter functionality for users to find profiles based on different criteria.

Finalize Error Handling and Loading Indicators for smooth user experience.

Ensure the application is responsive for mobile users.
